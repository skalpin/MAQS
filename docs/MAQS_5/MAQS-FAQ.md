# Base features
## Logging
- Yes, No, or On Fail and the Defaults are  Log = No, LogType = Console LogLevel = INFORMATION and FileLoggerPath = Test dll "log" sub folder    File Format options: txt, html, console
### Log Level
![The levels of logs](resources/logleveldiagram.png)  
Each log level is grouped into a hierarchy, with the highest log levels also including any messages from lower log levels in the hierarchy.
Verbose mode includes all information gathered by the logger, which includes any navigation that occurs on the page, and anytime the WebDriver attempts to find an element or interact with an element. Verbose mode will result in many, often superfluous, lines of information.
Information mode includes messages for when a WebDriver is loaded, a value is identified, an element is interacted with, or whenever the WebDriver throws an exception.
Generic mode is the default logging level. It includes performance timers, and log interactions such as when a performance timer log is saved.
Success mode will output a message anytime a soft assert is successful, or as a test ends and the test is successful.
Warning mode will output a message anytime a soft assert fails, the test is met with unexpected results, or the test configuration fails to update.
Error mode will only display messages that would fail a test. This includes a test failed, a test resulted in being inconclusive, a setup failed, or the final soft assert data contains any failed soft asserts.
Suspended mode will result in no information written to the log. 
## Soft Asserts
- Specific to a test (inside) These get logged to the Log and become Hard Asserts after use. AreEqual or FailTestIfAssertFailed or Assert.AreEqual  helps your testing approach be more efficient instead of having to fix individual failures.
## Performance Measures
- Human readable and requires a Name, Embedded Perf tests to start at different times, Basically it tells how long the data collection took using this as a stop watch
## TestObject
- Holds test specific objects and available in all Magenic MAQS flavors
## Waits
- GenericWait.WaitFor waits until exceptions are no longer thrown (calls the function N number of times) or GenericWait.WaitUntil  responds with true / false
## Customizations
- Utilizes the app.config which is Globally used information, avoids hard-coded code and you can add Key|Value custom pairs such as UserName =YOU PassWord=ABC   We also allow you to use 'default' 
# Test Run Settings - MSTest 
There are two types of file for configuring tests. *.runsettings are used for unit tests. And *.testsettings for lab environment tests, web performance and load tests, and for customizing some types of diagnostic data adapters such as IntelliTrace and event log adapters.  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file?view=vs-2017.  
Both test settings files are written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language).  
*_**TestSettings files have been deprecated and should no longer be used!**_  


## Run Settings Configurations
A .runsettings file can be added as a test setting to add additional configurations when running unit tests. This allows tests to be run on additional cores on a single machine, to run on different versions of the unit test framework, or to specify where the results of the test should be output.
### Adding Run Settings
To add a .runsettings file to a test solution, go to the top toolbar and under Test â†’ Test Settings, choose the "Select Test Settings File" option, and finally add a .runsettings file.  
![Remote Browser Settings](resources/AddNewTestSettings.png)  
Since there is no way to have Visual Studio generate a template of a .runsettings file, you can instead add an example .runsettings file to your solution such as this one found on Microsoft's MSDN website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file?view=vs-2017
