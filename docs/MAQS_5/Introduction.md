## Introduction to MAQS
MAQS stands for Magenic's automation quick start.

It â€¦
 - is a modular test automation framework
 - can be used as the base for your automation project or individual pieces can be used to enhance existing frameworks
 - is maintained/extended by Magenic volunteers

The main idea behind MAQS is to avoid **reinventing the wheel**. Most automation engagements have you doing the same basic steps to get a functioning framework implemented. Utilizing project templates, NuGet, and utility libraries we are able to have a functioning framework up and running in minutes, almost entirely removing on the initial time investment on implementing an automation solution.

MAQS is available in 2 flavors, The first  is Open Source and the other is Enterprise.


## Open Source 
Open source is the Selenium subset of Enterprise features and mainly used for testing web UI.

Open source is open to anyone to download without being a Magenic client. 


## Enterprise
Enterprise is the version of MAQS that includes all of the modules which includes (Appium, Database, Email, Selenium, and Web Services)

The Enterprise version of MAQS is provided to Magenic Clients utilizing automation.
